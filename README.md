# LineScanner
Scan the amount of lines of code in a folder!
## What is this?
It does what it says on the tin. You select a folder and it goes to every subdirectory and scans every file and counts lines of code.
## How do I add support for a programming language?
Open an issue telling me what is the extension of the programming language and I might add it into the list of programming extensions.
